#Scavenger Hunt - by PicoCTF
---
## Challenge Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/. Can you find it?

## Solution Steps
1. We will inspect the website source code first similar to the [Insp3ct0r](https://github.com/DhewaRadya/My-CTF-Learning-2023-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Exploitation/Insp3ct0r.md) steps

2. See, we get the first small piece of the flag
  ```html
     <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Scavenger Hunt</title>
      <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
      <script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
    </head>
  
    <body>
      <div class="container">
        <header>
      <h1>Just some boring HTML</h1>
        </header>
  
        <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tabintro', this, '#222')" id="defaultOpen">How</button>
        <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tababout', this, '#222')">What</button>
  
        <div id="tabintro" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>How</h3>
      <p>How do you like my website?</p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="tababout" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>I used these to make this site: <br/>
        HTML <br/>
        CSS <br/>
        JS (JavaScript)
      </p>
    <!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
        </div>
  
      </div>
  
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

3. We can continue to search it up around the CSS file to get the second flag, and in the JS file we receive an information about indexing on website by Google
   ```
   /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
   ```
   So as we know Google index our website by using robots.txt file

4. Make a change on the website link to access the robots.txt file
   ```
   view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/robots.txt
   ```
   and we get the another piece of the flag, yet another hint
   ```
   # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
   ```
    
5. Apache directory is set in a ".htaccess" file. Same way as before let access the directory and we can see the next part of the flag
   ```
   # Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
   # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
   ```
   
6. We can see that some information are store on his Mac. As we know that attributes in mac are saved in a ".DS_Store" file. Let access that and we will get the last piece of the flag
   ```
   Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _35844447}
